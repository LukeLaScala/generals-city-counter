generals-city-counter
=========

A Chrome plugin that shows an estimated city count next to each player in a [Generals.io](http://generals.io) game. The player row will flash when their city count increases from zero. The extension uses the [statistical mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_(statistics)) from the last 10 turns (where the army count increased) to guess a player's city count.
